###### **SHOP YOGALA JEWELRY [HERE](https://www.etsy.com/shop/yogala). **

Made from materials originating from India, Colombia, Mexico, and wherever else in the world I might find myself. I love to collect unique pieces, such as beads and pendants, and turn them into jewelry.

###### How did Yogala Jewelry come to be?

I've been handcrafting since I was a kid - that's why I like cooking, after all! I enjoyed making my own jewelry and clothes in high school, and when I became a yoga instructor, I immediately began thinking of creating my own line of yoga clothes and jewelry. That dream is slowly becoming a reality, and the first humble step was creating **Yogala Jewelry**!

Last time I visited the beautiful country of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Colombia**</span>, my husband's birth place, I took a trip to the hidden marketplace with his cousin, discovering an array of colors, shapes and tools to make your own jewelry! Colombia is known for mining gold and emeralds, and although I can't afford to put such precious metals and gems in my jewelry (yet), there are plenty of other gorgeous materials to choose from.

I fell in love with all the colorful beads that I encountered, it was hard to pick and choose. I brought home with me bags of beads, pendants, and other fun pieces  - and Yogala was born! Since then, I have added more materials to my collections, including Rudraksha and other beads from India. I have also picked up some beautiful pieces when I visited <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Mexico**</span>. I love the fact that I can put various pieces from different cultures into my collections to create a colorful array of Yoga inspired Malas (necklaces).

Malas are prayer beads used in Hindu and Buddhist traditions to perform mantra meditation or prayer. Mala prayer beads consist of 108 pieces, a spiritual number revered in many spiritual traditions. It is said mantra is most effective when repeated 108 times, when used for prayer or meditation. Hence the size of prayer Mala.
