###### Hi and welcome to the Yogala Jewelry Ambassador program.

Before completing the form, we would like you to revise our terms of contract and make sure you are on board! We are seeking to create a relationship of trust and mutual benefit with our ambassadors. There are plenty of benefits in it for you, and we would like you, as our ambassador, to help spread the word about Yogala with the world!

###### **Benefits of Becoming an Ambassador:**

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Swag</span>. **Once accepted, you will receive a unique code to use at our Yogala Jewelry Etsy store ([yogala.etsy.com](https://www.etsy.com/shop/yogala)). With this code you will be able to purchase an Ambassador package at a low, discounted price. You will have an option of picking a Yoga Mala Necklace or Yoga Mala Necklace and two Bracelet set. The fee simply covers shipping and handling.

**Ambassador Mala package - 20.00$**

**Ambassador Mala + Bracelet set package - 30.00$**

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Your Discount Code</span>. **Our Ambassadors receive a unique discount code for 25% off any Yogala Merchandise. It is for your use only and not to be shared with others.

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Discount Code for your followers</span>. **Each Ambassador also receives a unique discount code of 10% to share with your social media followers and yoga students.

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Getting your name out there</span>. **If you are accepted as an Ambassador, we will share your bio and picture on our site. We will also connect with you on social media and if you post pictures wearing Yogala Jewelry, we will, with your permission, share them on our social media and/or site.

##### **Duties of an Ambassador**

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Follow and Share Yogala Jewelry</span>. **It's that simple! As our ambassador, we find it logical that you would follow Yogala on social media. After all, this might just be the way we connected in the first place. However, we find it's good to have this in writing. We have an Instagram and Twitter account, a Facebook page and a website. Follow us, and then share with your followers - they might like our Malas and bracelets for themselves!

If you are a Yoga or Fitness Instructor, Style Blogger, etc., promote Yogala by wearing it and sharing our information with anyone who might like it.
