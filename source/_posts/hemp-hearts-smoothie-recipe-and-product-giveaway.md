_I have received Hemp hearts products to review and giveaway from Manitoba Harvest, as part of the Sweat Pink Ambassador program._

I've been drinking/eating <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**smoothies &amp; smoothie bowls**</span> for breakfast for some time now, and they worked perfectly in the heat of California (as well as Florida before that). But now that I have moved to Asheville, NC, I got worried smoothies will fall off my menu to be replaced by warm oatmeals and other heating winter foods. Luckily, I was wrong - at least for now! It was a delicious 73 degrees when I went for a trail run midday, and a smoothie was a perfect pre-run fuel.

I am enjoying more smoothies and juices these days, I really feel like I need more light **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">rawfoods</span>** in my diet - although I have conveniently named myself Girl in the Raw, keeping up with a fully raw diet isn't as easy as it seems, and not always the most optimal solution for my energy levels. I am in training, so to say, for a marathon - I'm running Vegas next weekend, and I need some solids to get me out there when I don't feel like it, and to replenish after a run session.

Without further ado, here's the easiest delicious smoothie recipe you'll ever need:

### Hemp Hearts Smoothie

###### INGREDIENTS (makes 2):

_{vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, added sugar-free, vegan protein rich, high in fiber, high in omega}_

*   1 banana (fresh or frozen)
*   1/2 cup raspberries (I used frozen)
*   1/2 cup pineapple (I used frozen)
*   1 cup almond milk
*   2 scoops Hemp &amp; Flax fiber blend
*   3 tbsp of Hemp Hearts from Manitoba Harvest to top
**INSTRUCTIONS**:

1.  It's a smoothie, you know what to do! Throw the ingredients in a blender, blend and enjoy. If you need more liquid, add either almond milk or water.
Hemp seeds are delicious, crunchy and an easy <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**superfood**</span> to add to your diet. As I began to dive into the world of vegan and raw foods, I discovered that there are certain foods that are more nutritionally dense, loaded with vitamins and minerals, than others. Those foods are oftentimes described as superfoods. Some of the more known staples include chia seeds, goji berries, or spirulina. Hemp seeds are also becoming quite popular in the world of superfoods, and for a good reason.

I find them very easy to add to already known dishes, because they don't have an overwhelmingly strong flavor, smell or look to them! Even if you've never tried them before, you probably wouldn't notice them sprinkled on a salad or a smoothie. The flavor is nutty and neutral, it goes well with both sweet and salty dishes!

I've been using hemp seeds for a long time, they've been a staple in my kitchen since I've discovered them. Unlike other superfoods or specialty items, I never forget to use these and don't have to get too creative when adding them to my diet. I've honestly always used this particular brand as well, [Manitoba Harvest](http://manitobaharvest.com), and I was very happy when they sent me a package to use in a recipe, as well as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**GIVEAWAY**</span> to one lucky reader.

Yes, you've read that right!

###### **BENEFITS OF HEMP SEEDS:**

In case you weren't sure, yes hemp comes from that same plant Cannabis or pot comes from! Right on, dude...

However, hemp is not a drug nor will it have the same effects. Hemp contains 0.001 % of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, or the active ingredient of cannabis) and will not cause any intoxication or psychoactive effects (or give you a false positive drug test). Hemp has (clearly) been somewhat controversial since it became a popular health store item, as people are mainly familiar with different parts and uses of this plant, and unfamiliar with it's health benefits. However, hemp is very versatile - you can make anything from paper, to clothing, to fuel, to food from it! And it some cases, as in paper production, it is a more sustainable option than a lot of methods we've been using.

So here are some benefits of adding hemp seeds to your every day diet:

*   High in protein! It's an excellent, complete plant based source
*   Rich in omega fatty acids, amino acids and minerals
*   High in Vitamin E, Magnesium and Potassium
*   It aids in balancing blood sugar, as well as maintaining strong energy levels
*   Lowers blood pressure
*   Essential amino acids and fats in it are great for skin, hair and nail health
*   Anti-inflammatory, aids digestion
*   Fiber rich
*   and many more....
