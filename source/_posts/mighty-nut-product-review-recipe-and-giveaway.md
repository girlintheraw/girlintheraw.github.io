_I received Mighty Nut Peanut Butter products as a #SweatPink Ambassador, to sample and review on my blog. This is a sponsored post.&nbsp;_

The day powdered peanut butter was invented, lives of thousands of nut-obsessed individuals, such as myself, were changed forever... Until now, I was only familiar with one brand, PB2, but it seems other experienced nut butter companies are jumping on the new trend as well! Cue in the Mighty Nut.

Peanut Butter &amp; Co, a little nut company you might be familiar with already, recently&nbsp;launched <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**[Mighty Nut](http://mightynut.com)**</span>, a&nbsp;new powdered peanut butter!

Now, you might be wondering, what the heck is "powdered" peanut butter and how is it made? Well here is a professional description given by the company itself: Mighty Nut&nbsp;is created from&nbsp;quality USA grown peanuts. The peanuts are roasted, then pressed, to remove most of the fat. What remains is protein, fiber and delicious peanut buttery taste.&nbsp; Mighty Nut powdered peanut butter can be rehydrated and used as a spread or dip, or as an ingredient in baking, cooking or smoothies and it is available in four delightful varieties:

*   Original
*   Vanilla
*   Chocolate
*   Flax &amp; Chia
There are two important points I want you to take from this:

1\. They remove the fat from peanuts! And not in a this-is-a-low-fat, but super unhealthy, sugary and fake product. The nuts are simply pressed, I assume in a similar fashion in which we extract fat&nbsp;from nuts and other products to get the oils we use (like peanut oil! Or avocado, olive, coconut oil..), and what is left over from the fat is then turned into this powdery goodness.

2\. There are flavors to choose from! I love the vanilla flavor I got, it's very mildly sweet, but here is a noticeable difference from the original flavor, which is more nutty and salty (they have added salts, but the sodium content is still decent (75-115mg, all around 5% of recommended daily value, based on a 2000 kcal diet). I would like to try the flax and chia next, because of the added superfoods benefits.

If you've never tried this type of a product, you might be wondering what to do with it! Here are a few suggestions and tips:

*   Mixing 2 tbsp of Mighty Nut with 1 tbsp of water, or almond milk, will give you a nice creamy substance similar to your good old peanut butter, just less oily. You can spread it, use it as a dip, or a sauce, and so on. I don't like it on bread as much, but I love it with apple slices. It's great on anything sweet, like pancakes!
*   Smoothies and Smoothie Bowls! My favorite way to use my Mighty Nut (two recipes to follow below).
*   Mix it in yogurt and top with granola.
*   Cook it in oatmeal.
*   Mix it in plain vanilla ice cream, for a flavor and nutrition boost (yes, I do this!)
*   Make a peanut salad dressing or a dip, particularly in asian style cuisine.
*   Add it to coconut milk for a peanut flavored curry sauce.
*   Use it in baking - from brownies to cupcakes to creams for cakes.
My creativity is running out by this point! If you think of anything else, do let me know in the comments! My favorite and most common way to use it, is to blend it in smoothies or with yogurt for breakfast. I tried both flavors in two preparations, and it turned out delicious. Just a scoop or two will give your meal that delish peanut butter flavor (of course, if you are not a fan of PB, then this probably isn't for you).

*   Hemp seeds
*   Granola (I used Bakery on Main Fiber power, a gluten free berry granola)

## Peanut butter and Jelly Smoothie Bowl

[![originalpb](http://girlintheraw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/originalpb-960x960.jpg)](http://girlintheraw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/originalpb.jpg)

**INGREDIENTS**:

*   1 scoop of Original Mighty Nut peanut butter
*   1/2 cup yogurt (I used unsweetened coconut milk yogurt by So Delicious)
*   1/2 cup raspberries
*   1/2 fresh or frozen banana
*   2-3 ice cubes (optional)
**TOPPINGS**:

*   Fresh raspberries
*   Hemp seeds
*   Hemp granola
**INSTRUCTIONS**:

1.  Same as the previous recipe, blend your ingredients and enjoy! You might need to scrape the sides a few times if it's really thick, or add a few table spoons of almond milk to thin it out. Toppings are my suggestions, they are always optional!

The first smoothie bowl was much sweeter than the second one, because the vanilla Mighty nut is a tad sweeter, but also because I used a different yogurt as a base! I like to pair sweet smoothie/yogurt bowls with less sweet granola, and vice versa.

Both of these are filling and tasty breakfast or snack options. The Mighty nut adds protein to the mix, and hemp seeds and granola added an omega punch, fiber and healthy fat dose.
