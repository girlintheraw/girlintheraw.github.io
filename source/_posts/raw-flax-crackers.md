One of the very first foods I discovered when I began my trip into rawfood land were raw flax crackers! They are incredibly easy to make, don't really take long prep time (just dehydrating time), and they replace the good old bread you will crave if you go raw, at least from time to time. You can make your crackers on the neutral side, kind of like bread, and eat them sweet or savory!

The magic of flax seeds is that when soaking them, they will become a little gooey and sticky, even more than chia seeds. That makes them an incredible raw food asset. It's hard to replicate the stickiness of flour or gluten, as well as texture of baked or cooked goods. One thing I like to mix with flax seeds is veggie or fruit leftovers from juicing! That's a great way to recycle and not waste food with valuable nutrients, like the fiber left over from extraction. This recipe includes prepped veggies, but if you have any juicing leftovers - use it.

#### INGREDIENTS

_{Vegan, Raw, Gluten-free, soy free, sugar free}_

(makes a few days' supply):

*   1/2 cup golden flax seeds
*   1/2 cup brown flax seeds
*   1/2 cup shredded zucchini
*   3-4 tbsp chia seeds
*   1/2 cup almond meal (can make it yourself)
*   2-3 tbsp nutritional yeast
*   pinch of pink Himalayan salt (make it light if you want to eat them with sweets)

#### DIRECTIONS:

1.  Place flax and chia seeds in a bowl, cover with water and let stand for at least half an hour, mixing it a few times. Once you see the seeds soaking and drinking up the water, add more if needed. We want our mass mushy, not too dry but not too runny.
2.  Once your seeds are soaked, add the rest of the ingredients and fold it in. You want your mixture not too dry or too wet, with time you will find that just right consistency.
3.  If you don't have almond meal, process almonds in your Vitamix or food processor. You can keep a few pieces in for crunch.
4.  Prep your food dehydrator. Taking a spoonful at a time, spread them on your dehydrating sheet in a cracker form. The thinner, the quicker they are ready.
5.  Set your dehydrator to 108-116 F, and leave in for 4+ hours (depending on your dehydrator). Once they are dry enough, flip them around and dry for another 2h+.
6.  Serve with your favorite foods and enjoy! I enjoyed mine with raw almond butter, pink lady apple slices, and strawberries for breakfast!
