Cookies - the name itself suggests a fuzzy, warming, comforting sensation. Like a warm cup of cacao and a cookie on a rainy Saturday afternoon. Or a fresh baked cookie smell filling up the kitchen on a Christmas morning. Or the nickname your first sweetheart assigned you back in school oh so many years ago... Cookies are magical!

And they can be such a hassle to make... I consider myself a decent cook (note: see this blog or my IG account), but baking delicious treats is a whole another animal in itself. For every 3-5 baking attempts, maybe one comes out _truly satisfactory_. I definitely haven't mastered the skill yet, and these cookies are just a result of another speculative attempt in the kitchen. I mean, look at them - they look like poop. Yes, I know it and I said it. These are **poop cookies**. It's ok though, because they are tasty and they are definitely healthy! Made with only natural, delicious ingredients, after all, how bad can they come out to be?

As I come from a [history](http://girlintheraw.com/?page_id=666 "My health history") of allergies and have had a 'limiting' diet most of my life, I am used to making (and making up) preparations without common ingredients, such as flour or sugar. These cookies are **super free** of so many common allergens and non-vegan items! They are:

*   Vegan
*   Gluten free
*   Dairy Free
*   Egg Free
*   Soy Free
*   Flourless
*   Grain free
*   (Added) Sugar free
*   Chocolate free (hey, some people might want that!)
*   Can be made Nut free by subbing almond butter for sunflower seed butter, and cashew meal for ground seeds of choice.
The best part about these cookies is that the ingredients are ready to eat as they are, so you could very easily indulge in eating the whole cookie dough as it is without a hint of guilt or belly problems (well, if you eat a pound of it you might get a belly ache. Might. Still worth a try). They can be made **raw** by dehydrating instead of baking, and if I had the time I would have done that myself, but I was in an urgent need of cookies so I baked them instead.

###### **You will need:**

*   Blender or food processor.
*   Baking sheet and baking paper.
*   Spoon or spatula.
*   Oven or dehydrator.

Look at this creamy goodness - all the ingredients mashed up into a delicious, lick-your-fingers cookie dough paste. The process is super easy - dump all ingredients into a blender or food processor, form cookies, bake at 350 for about 15 minutes (or dehydrate for 10-12hours at 108) and you are done!

The mass is very liquid and creamy, as it is flourless and the cashew meal doesn't absorb as much liquid as some other GF flours, however, the cookies come out nice, soft and chewy afterwards. I will warn you that even the paper sheet wasn't enough to prevent sticking (I definitely advise you not to bake without a sheet because it must be a hassle to remove cookies without crumbling them).

###### 5 Ingredient Vegan &amp; Gluten Free Cookies:

###### **Makes about 10 medium cookies**

_{vegan, gluten free, soy free, dairy free, sugar free, processed ingredient free, __grain free, flour free}_

*   5-6 dates (I use Medjool, if using small dates increase the amount)
*   1 very ripe banana
*   2-3 tbsp almond butter
*   1/2 cup cashew meal (add more if too liquid)
*   pinch salt
*   Water to blend
*   OPTIONAL: Cashew pieces to top
1\. Place all ingredients in blender or processor, add water as needed to start the mass moving (may need less if using a processor vs. a blender). Blend till a nice smooth consistency is formed. If you want the cookies to be chunky, add cashew pieces in later.

2\. Preheat the oven to 350\. Place the wax paper or tin foil on your baking sheet, and form cookie sized pieces with your mass. Top with cashew pieces to decorate.

3\. Bake for 15 minutes or until chocolate brown and dry on the outside, but still soft - you do not want them to get too dry! Alternatively, place in dehydrator on 108 and dry for 8 hours. Check if ready, turn if needed, and dry for extra 2-4 hours if necessary.

That is all there is to it!

You can always dress up your cookies with dried fruit, different nuts or nut butter, coconut shreds, or sunflower butter for a nut free version. They will keep for 3-5 days in the fridge, but I advise you eat them quickly as they are made with wholesome raw ingredients and no preservatives or flours, so they might start to spoil quickly. The cookies have natural sweet taste from banana and dates, but are not very sweet, so add stevia, coconut nectar or maple syrup if you want them to rock your sweet tooth!

**Enjoy!**
