Don't you love using romantic (i.e. cheesy) names to describe your foods, like I do? It simply adds a special touch to my 'creations', even the basic ones like this smoothie bowl.

Piña Coladas take me to a beach far far away..  Tall glass in my hand, laying on the sand and taking in a spectacular view of the ocean that never ends... And I don't even drink! Imagine the subconscious effects this name has on the partying folk - it's an instant hit!

Actually, I believe all foods can become magical and tropical, exotic and unique if we put some love and care into our work. All it needs is a special touch of care and consciousness, while prepping our meals and sitting down at the table. Love does flow through the stomach if you ask me! Love for ourselves, our bodies and minds.

I say minds because I for one feed my emotions and thoughts with my meals more often than I feed my body. I sometimes try to induce visualisation and conscious scientific thought when the hunger strikes - and really think what is it that my <span style="text-decoration: underline;">BODY</span>  needs now. And <span style="text-decoration: underline;">HOW MUCH</span> food would be enough to freed it. Once you let your intuition and your knowledge of nutrition give you an answer, you see it differs greatly from what the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">MIND</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">wants</span>! SHOCKING DISCOVERY on my part here in this little experiment. You mean, my body doesn't really need another serving? And that delicious s'mores experiment* I had after work at 11pm didn't do anything for my body but add a few pounds?

*_ Super secret dessert concoction about to be revealed: vegan marshmallow, Speculoos cookie butter (seriously, DO NOT try it if don't know what it is), honey peanut butter and dark chocolate melted over crunch of your choice! o.m.g._

&nbsp;

At least I work on starting my days right, when I have the time for it. A beautifully crafted, fresh and nutritious breakfast kick-starts every day all over again, no matter my late night expeditions. I have seen the tremendous impact decorating my plate has on my experience with food. It makes my treats so much sweeter!
