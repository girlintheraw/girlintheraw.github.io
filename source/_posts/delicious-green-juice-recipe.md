Juicing has been around forever, and in popular nutrition media (read: magazines, blogs, talks) for a few decades now. It seems like the popularity of drinking fresh squeezed veggie and fruit juices is progressively rising, but so is the controversy surrounding the health benefits and shortcomings of the practice.

I really do not want to get in on the discussion - as far as I am concerned, fresh raw juice is about the healthiest nutrition punch you can ingest. Wether you choose to drink solely juices for a few days to detox, or you like to enjoy a juice with breakfast every now and then, I definitely advise everyone to at least give green juice a try.

Now, I know what you might be thinking. _**Ewww... green juice is gross!**_ Well here's a recipe for a delicious one! No, really, it's super tasty (hence the comment in the title - no, really it is!).

###### **GREEN JUICE RECIPE {makes 2}:**

_{vegan, vegetarian, raw, gluten free, paleo, juicing, extract}_
<pre>**3 apples (I love Pink Lady best for munching on, it's very sweet in juices)**</pre>
<pre>**1 bunch kale **</pre>
<pre>**1/2 medium pineapple**</pre>
<pre>**4 medium carrots**</pre>
<pre>**1 piece of ginger (as big as you can handle)**</pre>
<pre>**1/2 lime **</pre>

###### **INSTRUCTIONS:**

Wash, core and cut all your fruits and veggies and place them in a big bowl before starting your juicing process. Preparation makes it much faster (just in case you are one of those lazy juicers like I am). Depending on the type of a juicer you have, you may need to combine the kale leaves with hard pieces for easier processing.

I have a masticating juicer, Samson 6 in 1 Juicer model GB9002, in case you were wondering. I chose a masticating model to maintain the molecules as intact as possible. With high speed blenders and juicers that cut the juice out of a plant, it is advisable to drink the extract as soon as possible (within 15 minutes) to prevent oxidation. When purchasing mine, I got advised by a professional vegan chef at a local restaurant on the model, and I am pretty satisfied.

I usually run my pulp through the juicer again and again till all the juice is out, and this way have very little residue. If you are one of the people that resent juicing because you feel like it's wasteful, this is the tip that will make you feel better about it! It sure helped me. I try to use the leftovers in cookies, breads, burgers as much as possible, but if I can't for whatever reason, I do not feel bad throwing out whatever pulp was left because I usually do not have a great residue.

###### **QUICK TIPS for veggie and fruit pairings :**

&nbsp;

*   To make your green juices palatable, specially in the beginning, combine sweet or pungent greens with sweet fruits. Leave arugula and mung bean sprouts (yes, some people juice sprouts for an extra dose of green awesomeness) for when your taste buds get used to green juices.
*   Start with spinach, kale, cucumbers and pair them with sweet apples, pineapple, and citruses. Pineapple is by far my favorite juice, its sweet and sour and makes literally any veggie taste great!
*   Carrots and beets are very sweet and therefore almost don't even count as veggie juice in terms of flavor, but they pack on the nutritional benefits.
*   According to Ayurveda, fruits and veggies do not mix. From personal experience and understanding, I believe juicing is an exception to this rule. When removing fiber, both with take about an equal amount of time to digest and be processed by the body.
*   However, stick to the mono-meal rule of Ayurveda as much as possible. Do not use too many ingredients in one juice as it will translate to too much information for the body to process. I try to stick with 4 main ingredients, plus herbs or additions. In this recipe, I consider lime and ginger spices, not main ingredients.
