I am so excited to join #1MillionMinutes with SweatPink! This summer my goal is to do 3000 minutes of running, while wearing my favorite pink running shoes.

I predict that we’ll accomplish the goal of #1MillionMinutes - we’ll actually hit 2.5 million of minutes this summer! I predict that running or yoga will be the top-logged movement.

I'll get extra minutes in by walking my dog around the neighborhood!

My favorite way to get extra minutes in is by trail running with my husband and my dog. My dog Zen is my BEST activity partner because he is so adventurous. Our favorite way to relax post-workout is to eat (of course!) and take a nap.

I tag my BFF [Sweet Sattva](http://www.sattvawellness.com/), [She Mom Fit](http://shemomfit.com/), and my fellow instructors and students at [Yoga Core Fit](http://yogacorefit.com/) to help us reach #1MillionMInutes… or more!

Join us and track your progress at [Sweat Pink](http://fitapproach.com/1millionminutes/)!

I'm excited and a bit nervous about this challenge - although I log my workouts for myself most days, I have never made myself accountable for tracking my progress and sweat minutes publicly before, for this long of a time period. I am planning on doing weekly summaries on my blog, and share activity on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GirlinTheRaw) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/girlintheraw/)!
