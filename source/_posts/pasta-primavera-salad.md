Primavera is such a breezy, romantic word that simply means _spring_ in Italian and Spanish. Doesn't it make this season sound so much more exotic, as opposed to the English word (or Croatian for that matter - proljece)?

Pasta Primavera is a dish you can find on so many menus in various restaurants, and each version is made from different ingredients.
Spring time is the season of bloom, of growth and rebirth, it is the period in which the nature is awakening from it's winter sleep. Wonderful variety of fruits and veggies grows in this period, and they are filled with fresh energy or _prana_. Therefore, our main dish today, Pasta Primavera, simply means pasta loaded with delicious fresh veggies. You can make it your own and add anything your heart desires, and make it light and nutritious.

Since all my veggies are raw, I chose to call it a salad recipe. You can opt to cool your pasta and serve the dish completely cold as a salad, or keep it warm like I did.

###### Ingredients:

*   1.5 cup gluten free pasta of choice (I used brown rice fussily from Trader Joe's)
*   1 medium carrot - shredded
*   1/2 green bell pepper
*   5-6 cherry tomatoes
*   1/4 cup cannelloni beans
*   salt and pepper to taste
*   pinch smoked paprika
*   1-2 tbsp Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO)
*   3 tbsp Vegan Cheese shreds (I used Mozzarella from TJ's)
*   Optional: Medium haas avocado

###### Directions:

1.  Cook pasta according to directions. Depending on the brand, Gluten Free pasta may take longer to make (comparing to white flour pasta), but be cautious to follow the instructions as it can just as easily overcook. Always cook in salty water, you can optionally add a table spoon of oil to the water as well.
2.  In the meantime, prep your veggies. I like my carrots shredded for pasta, you can slice them as you like. Cut peppers in small cubes, and cherry tomatoes in halves.
3.  Drain and rinse your beans well. I used organic packaged from Whole Foods, but you can make yours fresh and from scratch as you like (in which case, allow more time for cooking or prep ahead of time).
4.  Once the pasta is done, rinse well and add EVOO, then mix so the pasta doesn't stick. Add in all your veggies and beans, and any spices you may like. Add your cheese last. You can serve it with additional sauce (like marinara or vegan mayo, both of which I like very much).
5.  Optional: Cube your avocado and mix it in your pasta salad. I just like to eat mine by spoon, on it's own!
