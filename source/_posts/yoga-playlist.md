As a yoga instructor, I don't only want to provide a unique and personal experience to each and every of my students in class, but a unique experience for myself as well. How does having a good&nbsp;Yoga Playlist relate to that? I'll let you know...

Doing something you love for a living is the best gift, and considering polls have shown a staggering 70% of Americans do a job they hate (from Gallupâ€™s 2013 State of the American Workplace study), it's quite rare these days as well. But even when doing something you love, after a certain period you may find yourself trapped in a repetitive pattern.

That is definitely true for teaching yoga, specially if you teach a good amount of classes per week, and your classes are taught in the same style or school of yoga. Although some find comfort in a steady schedule, if you are anything like me, and like to keep things interesting and stay alert, try new things, and grow, teaching the same class over and over again gets tired&nbsp;very quickly!

Besides keeping your yoga knowledge and personal practice, one thing that helps me stay interested is keeping my&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">**yoga playlist game on point**</span>, specially when teaching back to back classes.&nbsp;

### Creating Playlists

I use a few different services: [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/), [Amazon Music](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amazon-music-with-prime-music/id510855668?mt=8) (connected to my Prime account), and [Tidal](http://tidal.com/). I have used Spotify and Pandora from time to time as well. I suggest investing in an app that doesn't cost too much and does everything you want it to. There are pros and cons for each.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">**iTunes**</span> is very convenient as it's already connected to my Music app on the iPhone. I keep all the music I really like to listen to personally on it. 90% of the music is in album form, because in my opinion, it doesn't pay off to buy singles on iTunes. &nbsp;

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Amazon Music**</span> comes free with your Prime account. It's easy to search for artists or songs, create playlists, and then you can either keep them in your online library, or download them to your offline library. I prefer to to the latter as I use my iPhone to play music in my classes, and use it in Airplane mode not to get disturbed.&nbsp;

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tidal</span>** is a fancy and pricy service created by Jay-Z. If you enjoy good quality sound, then this is for you because to my understanding, this is as high quality as it's gets in mobile and desktop music applications. My husband is the one with the high taste, and as we have an extensive music system at home with fancy speakers, amplifiers and other things I may not know much about, he prefers to use Tidal - and even I can tell the difference in sound!&nbsp;

### Yoga Playlist for a Yoga Flow 60 minute practice

This is a Jamming Yoga Flow practice playlist - filled with funky beats by Santana and Bob Marley. It is neither too calm nor too upbeat, for me just right!&nbsp;

I created the&nbsp;following <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Yoga Playlist for a Yoga Flow 60 minute practice**</span> on Tidal, but you can obviously use a system you enjoy best, just keep in mind not all content might be available.

This playlist is 48:30 long, because I start my class with 5-7 minutes of silent meditation and _pranayama_ or breathing techniques, and end it with a few minutes of silence in and after _savasana_ (final resting pose or corpse pose). The last song on the playlist is very soothing and can be used for either wind-down, or _savasana_, but there is enough time on the playlist to have a silent _savasana_ if that is your preference.&nbsp;
