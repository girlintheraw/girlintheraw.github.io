If there is one thing that launched me over to the hippie side of town (if you know what I mean), is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**making my own Kombucha tea**</span>! I've been the do-it-youself type my whole life, and try to steer&nbsp;clear of processed foods as much as possible. I love preparing raw and cooked, plant based meals, and feel closer to nature, healthy and wholesome when I do it. But there are some preparations that seem just unusual and new to me, and I never think I could do it myself - like Kombucha! Now that I live in Asheville, home of Buchi brand, one of the best kombuchas I've ever tried, I constantly feel surrounded by&nbsp;this special Chinese "Tea of Immortality". There is a brewery on every corner of this hippy town, and although most make&nbsp;beer, Kombucha is also brewed in house and served at more locations I can count. After completing a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gut Health Workshop</span>, I received my first SCOBY (more on that later) and was ready to make my own sparkly probiotic drink. The only question was: How to make Kombucha tea? As it turns out, it's pretty easy! Follow this homemade Kombucha tea recipe, and you'll enjoy potentially unlimited Kombucha soon enough!

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">**SCOBY**</span>&nbsp;stands for symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast. Although most think Kombucha is made from a mushroom, and SCOBY certainly has that same look to it, it is simply a probiotic culture relatively similar to what Kefir or yogurt is made with. And if you've ever made your own yogurt or any other probiotic preparation, you will be familiar with the process it takes to brew Kombucha.&nbsp;

That thing floating in the jar in the above picture is SCOBY. This is a 'starter kit' for making your own Kombucha - a cup of actual Kombucha tea with a SCOBY. If you don't have access to a fresh one (having a friend to give you one is usually a great way to start), you can order Kombucha starters online or check your local health store. I have heard SCOBYs are sold dried as well, in that case you don't need/get a liquid starter. Either way, the process is the same. Some probiotics will grow if you just use a cup or two of the finished product, like yogurt. Unlike yogurt, however, Kombucha won't grow enough from just the bacteria in an old kombucha sample, SCOBY is key to making it happen.&nbsp;

As you can tell, there are just a few rules to follow when making Kombucha. First one is, do not mix metal with your bacteria. Second, be very gentle with your SCOBY. Third, if you plan to repeat this process, make sure to set unflavored Kombucha and SCOBY aside before flavoring and putting into lidded jars.&nbsp;

I love the slight tartness of Kombucha, and feel that ginger and other spices pair well with it, and give it that nice punch. As both Kombucha bacteria and ginger aid digestion, I feel like I'm getting a double dose of belly healthy ingredients.&nbsp;

There are many health benefits to drinking Kombucha on a regular basis. This drink is a natural probiotic, therefore incredibly healthy for your digestion and overall healthy gut, which is linked to our overall health and mental and emotional stability. If you didn't know that, you might be as shocked as I was the first time I heard it - but yes, our gut and our mind and moods are incredibly connected!

There are four types of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**raw foods,**</span> namely&nbsp;raw, dehydrated, sprouted and fermented foods. Kombucha, being a fermented food, although made by cooking tea at first, is still considered a living and energizing substance, just like all raw foods. What's better than raw, living, probiotic, sparkling drink that makes your belly happy, and makes you happy as well? Not much, I'll tell you that!

Tell me, do you like Kombucha, and have you tried making it yourself?

## Happy belly...
