I believe that the key to a happy life is finding your inner connection. Connection inspires me to be the balanced person that I am today. I am lucky to have my mom and my husband in my life because they inspire me to live life to my fullest and to chase my dreams.

My dream is to one day teach yoga everywhere and to anyone, and even if it takes some sacrifice and a lot of growth, I know I’ll get there because I’m not afraid to dream big!

While I dream big, I hope to inspire others by living in connection with myself, universe and nature and sharing my honest experience.

Lorna Jane just released a fabulous new book, _[Inspired](http://www.lornajane.com/INSPIRED/Inspired)_, on health, fitness, and other lifestyle tips - you can expect a review of it soon on Girl in the Raw!

But before that, let's share our tips, experiences and inspirations in an Instagram challenge!

Join me, starting on Monday, July 13th for a fun 5 day #LJInspired Instagram Challenge hosted  by @FitApproach &amp; @LornaJaneActive.
