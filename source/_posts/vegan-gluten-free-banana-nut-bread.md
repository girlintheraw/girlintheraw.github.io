###### The holidays are officially here!!! Ho ho ho...

I have great memories of Christmas time growing up, and I always get very warm and fuzzy when I see a decorated tree, Christmas lights, even snow flakes... But the absolutely best thing about the holidays is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**all the delicious holiday food**</span>! Am I right?

Making your favorite wintery and Christmasy recipes vegan and/or gluten free isn't as hard as it may seem! Take this delicious <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**vegan gluten free banana nut bread**</span>: traditionally made with eggs, milk, butter, white heavily processed gluten-full flour, the recipe is&nbsp;easily transformed into a light sweet treat for everyone!

I got an early Christmas present (for myself) this year from<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> [Swanson Health Products](https://www.swansonvitamins.com/).</span>&nbsp;Shopping online for healthy products has never been easier, and this is one of the most comprehensive sites I have ever seen - they have everything from<span style="text-decoration: underline;">** vegan cosmetics to coconut oil (can't live without it) to vegan baking mixes.&nbsp;**</span>

Although I sure do love to cook, and am not half bad at it, baking definitely isn't my strong suit. Gluten free baking? Even more challenging. I have had my shares of crumbled cakes and dry cookies, and all sorts of disappointing kitchen tales. And although I am a definite advocate for cooking from the very scratch, I have found <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**gluten free baking mixes**</span> to be absolute life saviors!&nbsp;

I am a fan of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">[Bob's Red Mill products](https://www.bobsredmill.com/)</span>, they have a lot of gluten free options, they are organic and of course, mostly vegan - the one's I know, at least.&nbsp;

You can't have Banana Nut Bread without nuts, and although you can obviously get as creative as you want here, I really enjoy delicious <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Brazil Nuts**</span>! I treated myself to a gift this Christmas, and I'm savoring this bag slowly in a few different preparations.

Baking usually requires large quantities of oil, and I like to stir clear of processed, hydrogenated oils. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Coconut oil**</span> is always the best choice, specially extra virgin (meaning raw), organic kind. I'm loving Swanson's oil, it as a great price, tastes good and cooks well. I use it for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**oil puling**</span> as well, an ancient Ayurvedic detoxing ritual.&nbsp;

Putting all these delicious and healthy ingredients together, and voila - you've got yourself a Vegan Gluten Free Banana Nut Bread, perfect for holiday brunches and desserts.&nbsp;

[yumprint-recipe id='3']&nbsp;This bread did not last long in my house! A few of my favorite ways to eat it:

*   with almond butter
*   with apricot jam
*   with a fruity smoothie
*   post workout
*   with ice cream for a special treat!
Funny story: Acyuta loves Banana nut bread, and always jumps on the&nbsp;opportunity to buy it when he finds it. He even wants to get it at Starbucks, so I have to stop him, as that one's not vegan or even probably vegetarian because it must have eggs in it. Well, only recently did I find out that he actually thinks that Banana Nut is a thing! As in, there is a nut out there called the Banana nut. So I had to explain to him that this is banana, (coma) nut bread. Bead with bananas and nuts. I almost died laughing! Men...&nbsp;
