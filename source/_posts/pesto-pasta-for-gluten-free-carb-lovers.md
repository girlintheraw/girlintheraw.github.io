I love pasta, does that even need saying? I mean, who doesn't love pasta (if you answer ME, then we are no longer friends, sorry). I grew up on fine carbs of Mediterranean Croatian cuisine, and I have even witnessed my grandma and mom making their own pasta with their bare hands! Anything pasta related is the ultimate in comfort food for me.

I am trying to cut breads and pastas out, and find the most healthy alternatives to my favorite breads and pastries. After all, I ate the whitest of white pastas all through college, with red sauce and plenty of cheese, and I am sure a good percentage of my freshman 15 came from there. Pasta is so easy to cook and there are so many fabulous varieties, it's simply a must in any cookbook or pantry.

Luckily for all trying to quit white flour, the _Gluten-free movement_ is taking over, and there are plenty of pasta alternatives in my local Trader Joe's and Whole Foods. I hit the mark with my latest purchase of gluten free fussily from TJs, made of **quinoa and brown rice**. The pasta has a great texture, it's not mushy or too hard, and it goes down pretty light as well.

It's the improvised **pesto sauce** that really made my day! As it sometimes goes, I was scrolling through my Instagram feed when I saw a mouthwatering picture of green pasta dish and told myself - let's do this! I had no pine nuts at home, as they are the ultimate fancy nut, and when I do splurge on buying an ounce or two, I regret eating them any other way than as they are - so I rarely make any dishes with them! I was also out of fresh basil. Pesto is luckily a very versatileÂ sauce, all of the ingredients are easily replaceable to create your own unique version!

###### GLUTEN FREE PESTO PASTA RECIPE

_{vegan, gluten free, refined sugar free, high carb}_

**PESTO SAUCE:**

*   2 cups (handfuls) of sweet greens (spinach and baby kale)
*   1/4 cup pumpkin seeds
*   1/2 hass avocado
*   1-2 heaping tbsp nutritional yeast
*   1-2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
*   pinch salt and pepper
*   dash of oregano or other Italian spices
*   2-3 tbsp almond milk
**OTHER INGREDIENTS:**

*   1/4 cup vegan mozzarella (add in later)
*   1.5 cup gluten free fussily
*   1 cup rainbow cherry tomatoes
*   Quarter package of Gardain Vegan Mandarin chicken (with sauce)
&nbsp;

**INSTRUCTIONS**:

1.  Place all ingredients but the cheese in a blender or food processor, and pulse a few times. As you can see by the texture that I didn't blend it into a totally smooth paste. You want the avocado and spices blended well, but a few bigger pieces of greens and pumpkin seeds make for a nice, crunchy texture.
2.  Cook the pasta according to instructions. Drain well, mix in the pesto sauce (if you want less sauce in the pasta, leave a few tbsp of your mixture on the side).
3.  Mix in the cheese, and the cherry tomatoes (you can keep them whole if you want, I cut them in half - this way they release more juice and make for a flavorful combo with the pesto).
4.  For a full meal, prepare the vegan chicken and serve on the side with a large salad of choice.
5.  Serves well hot or cold. Enjoy!
