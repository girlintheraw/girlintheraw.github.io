Just for the record, I loved the color pink way before it was in style (and got out of style, and came back.. no one knows the real status today!). I loved it as a kid, I wore it all through my hight school rave party stage. I wear pink to yoga and on elegant occasions - which are many, thank you for asking. Even my baby pups, although a boy, wears, chews and sleeps on only pink!

_Before you call the humane society to report animal cruelty, let me just say he doesn't care what color his leash, bed and doggie jacket are! He is 'color blind' anyways. Or better yet, he loves it! He rocks pink all day long._

Back to my story... yes, I love eating pink too! I think my pink smoothie obsession speaks for itself. I know (and preach) that green is about the preferred color in health fashion world, but you gotta admit pink is still the cutest.

An array of pinks, purples and reds is found in many juicy fruits. Berries, Plums, Grapes, Dragon Fruit, Grapefruit, Lychee, Watermelon, Pomegranate,  Cherries, Guava, Papaya, Apples all carry antioxidant rich pigments. Sure fruits are super girly, but even some vegetables like Beets, Eggplant, Radish, Tomatoes, Peppers and Chard stems come pretty in pink!

The colors found in foods - natural colors found in raw one ingredient fruits, vegetables, grains, beans, legumes, nuts or seeds, originate from nutrients beneficial to our health.

_The richer the color, the richer the food in vitamins, minerals, antioxidant and alkaline properties._

**Betalains** are the phytonutrients that give foods like beets (get it?) their wonderful, impossible to wash off your white jeans, bloody purple color. Besides antioxidant properties, this pretty colored nutrient awards detoxifying and anti-inflammatory qualities to your foods.

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Watermelon and tomatoes are rich in </span>**Lycopene**<span style="line-height: 1.5;">, that has been linked to lowering the risk of cancer, particularly prostate, though this research has been deemed insufficient in data to be approved by the FDA. Nothing unusual. Diabetes, osteoporosis, and aging related muscular degeneration call Lycopene an enemy.  </span>Sweet berries contain **Ellagic acid** that is also known as a cancer fighting substance.

Interestingly, these nutrients are found in dietary supplements - but you can get them fresh from the plant source! Although most research related to health benefits of various nutrients is insufficient to be 'official', I am a promoter of plain ol' _logic _- or what I consider logic.

I do not pile numbers, latin names and results of statistical analysis in my mind and use them as nutritional knowledge. Don't get me wrong,  I do admire people who can explain the vibrant color of my breakfast smoothie through medical language (though I haven't met many people that actually do. Western medical science isn't directed towards using food as dugs and remedies.)

I simply believe we come from dirt, from nature, from the five elements (earth, water, fire, air and ether) and the ideal food for our growth, sustenance and healing is found in the same source, nature. The soil, water, sun light. Those strong flavors, smell and color speak for the level of nutrition my food contains.

Unfortunately, most of our foods are loosing their natural properties detected by our senses, specially the smell. Even fruits, veggies, grains, beans are being grown as _fast food, _in water not soil, under artificial light and in record timing. The first sense I use to compare and pick my foods is the smell. I grew up with access to my family's gardens, fields and vineyards, a I vividly remember the true smell of a freshly picked tomato. I try not to buy foods that don't smell, and the same with colors! Taste is a gamble, you take it home and see what happens, just like most dates these days.. (that's a joke. I don't date.)

##### <span style="color: #f84dbb;">Pretty in Pink </span>

##### <span style="color: #f84dbb;">Coconut Cashew raspberry cream </span>

###### <span style="color: #f84dbb;">_[vegan, GF, raw]_</span>

<span style="color: #f84dbb;">1 cup raw cashews (better if soaked)</span>

<span style="color: #f84dbb;">2-3 tbsp coconut butter (different than coconut oil, but just wonderful!)</span>

<span style="color: #f84dbb;">1/4 cup shredded coconut, a pinch set aside for topping</span>

<span style="color: #f84dbb;">1/4 cup fresh or frozen raspberries</span>

<span style="color: #f84dbb;">pinch vanilla extract</span>

<span style="color: #f84dbb;">1/4 cup or less coconut water, coconut milk or other nut milk, to blend</span>

<span style="color: #f84dbb;">few drops of vanilla stevia, coconut sugar or other sweetener </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">DIRECTIONS:</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">1\. Put all ingredients in a Vitamix and blend. Place in the freezer to cool for 30min or more, if you desire more of an icy treat (it does make for a fabulous ice-cream). Serve with fruits and coconut as a breakfast preparation. </span>

<span style="color: #000000;">My blending has changed significantly since I got my Vitamix. This would never have been so creamy and smooth in my ol' Ninja, but use any blender you have, just make sure there are no chunks left. </span>
