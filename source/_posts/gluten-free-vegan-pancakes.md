The holiday season is near and you've got some family visiting to do! Before you start freaking out because you are the only vegan in your family (and your dad still isn't over it after 12 years. What, that only happens to me?), check out these awesome pancakes.

Just look how beautiful they are...

Ah... much better.

These pancakes are a perfect **vegan brunch** preparation for those family and friends doubtful of your vegan ways. This will knock the belief that 'vegans only eat grass' out of the park in no time!

Surviving holiday season is not easy as a vegan, or gluten free, or any type of healthy eater. If you are looking for tips on managing this season in all vegan style, click [here](http://girlintheraw.com/?p=462 "Vegan’s guide to surviving the holiday season").

One of the best ways to reconnect with your loved ones while keeping true to your habits is inviting them over for a meal! Putting some love and care into your cooking will immediately show how much you care about them. The time you spend with your loved ones will pass smoothly, without you having to feel uncomfortable saying NO to everything offered at the holiday table - because you made it!

And if you do not have anyone on your list of visitors this year, well then make these all for yourself and enjoy the festive season by treating yourself to something super delicious! Confession: that's kind of how I made these. All for myself, my hubby and our pup... I might share them when someone comes to visit, but I'm not sure yet.

Sometimes, expecting to move the annual Christmas dinner from your mom's to your house is out of question. But having at least one holiday inspired brunch at your home with your loved ones is definitely doable.

**Brunch** is all in all my favorite meal of the day. You can eat anything! Literally anything - sweet, salty, fruits, veggies, grains, leftovers, scrambles... The possibilities are endless. That makes it a perfect ice-breaker meals with those not used to vegan dishes! First of, there is no great pressure on feeding people to their max (and then some), as there is on a Christmas night dinner. Second, you can hit many tastes and diets with various preparations. And finally, who doesn't like pancakes? Like seriously, name one person! Even raw foodies love making pancakes in the dehydrator. And even though these are not raw (read: 100% super healthy flawless), they are pretty darn healthy!

You will hit many targets in one swing by making them vegan and gluten free. From your sister's kid allergic to eggs to your fitness-freak cousin trying out paleo, this meal can satisfy many dietary needs while still delivering a delicious treat!

Making gluten free anything is not easy! There I said it. Gluten makes flours glue together easily, while GF doughs fall apart and crumble like anything. It takes some getting used to, and you may need to add or subtract some ingredients. I played with the recipe and managed to create pancakes in one piece - **success**!

###### **GLUTEN FREE VEGAN PANCAKES**

_{dairy free, egg free, soy free, sugar free}_

**INGREDIENTS**:

*   1/2 cup all purpose Gluten Free flour (Trader Joe's) - it's mainly rice flour
*   1/2 cup coconut flour
*   1/4 cup almond meal flour
*   1/4 cup oat flour (use GF certified if needed)*
*   1+ cup almond milk
*   1 ripe banana
*   3-4 tbsp vegan chocolate chip
*   2-3 tbsp chia seeds
*   pinch salt
*   pinch tumeric
*   drop vanilla essence
*   water as needed
*   1-2 drops of coconut oil for frying (omit if you have a non-stick frying pan)
*Oats are naturally a gluten free grain, but may be mixed with gluten while processing. If you have a gluten sensitivity or allergy, you are advised to buy GF certified oats. Otherwise, if you just like to avoid gluten because you feel better and healthier, like I do, you can use regular oats (I buy bulk organic at Whole Foods Market). Oat flour really makes these pancakes come together and prevents crumbling.

**PROCESS**:

1\. Add chia seeds to a cup, add a few tbsp of water and set aside to absorb. This is your chia egg replacer, you can use flax seeds or meal as well.

2\. Blend banana, almond milk, vanilla in a high speed blender like Vitamix till smooth and set aside.

3\. Add all the dry ingredients to a mixing bowl. You can make your own almond meal and oat flour by blending them in a high speed blender till very fine flour is created. If you are making almond flour out of whole almonds, I definitely recommend a strong blender, and/or blending for a few minutes to make it as smooth as possible.

4\. Fold in the dry ingredients (banana almond milk) into the dry ingredients and mix with a hand mixer spoon. Add your chia egg and chocolate chip.

5\. The gluten free flours like to absorb liquid super well, specially almond and coconut flour. So wait a minute, and add water or almond milk if needed - I usually have to, that's why it's a bit hard for me to estimate the amount of liquid needed.

6\. The mixture will not be as liquid as your regular, white flour pancake mix. It is actually pretty dry looking, as you can see by the pictures.

7\. Heat up the frying pan and add a tbsp of coconut oil if needed. Take a big soup spoon and scoop your pancake mixture onto a hot pan. Tap the spoon on top to flatten the mixture and form a pancake like shape - remember, it won't be so runny.

8\. Lowe the heat a bit and fry for 3-4 minutes before flipping, you want them to be as firmed up as possible to avoid crumbling. I like to cover my pan to cook the top of the pancake at the same time as well. After flipping, cook for about a minute on the other side. Set aside and cover to preserve warmth.

9\. Serve and enjoy! I like to top mine with as many delicious ingredients I can find, and have tons of fruit and toppings available on the side. Even tough these are gluten free and much lighter than your average pancake, they can be pretty heavy if you are used to eating light. That's why I always pair them with lots of fresh fruits.

10\. Spread the berry yogurt mixture on top! Recipe below.

You may notice there is **no sugar** in the pancakes. My mom taught me this a long time ago - sugar of any kind melts and sticks to the pan! If you want you cakes perfect, avoid it. Banana offers a nice sweet taste to them without being overpowering, and then you can go nuts with your sweet toppings.

**BERRY YOGURT**

1-2 cups of your favorite vegan yogurt (So Delicious Coconut milk yogurt in Plain or Vanilla is great for a soy free option)

1 cup mixed berries, predominantly strawberries (sweet!)

1 banana (optional)

Blend and enjoy! Adding more fruit will make it lighter, more yogurt - creamier. This is one of my favorite light toppings for pancakes, its fruity and breakfast-y, yet very filling so I avoid all the heavy and sugary syrups.![](/images/GFP3.jpg)

MY TOPPINGS:

*   Frozen mixed berries (strawberries, raspberries, blackberries). Thaw if that's your preference.
*   More vegan chocolate chip
*   Berry yogurt
*   Maple agave syrup (not sure if you can see it because it's pretty transparent).
&nbsp;

OPTIONAL TOPPINGS:

*   Chopped nuts
*   Nut butters - Almond butter, Peanut butter, Cashew butter
*   Maple syrup (grade B for the healthiest version)
*   Agave syrup
*   Raw cacao powder
*   Coconut nectar or sugar
*   Cinnamon
*   Jams and Preserves - that's how we eat thin pancakes (crepes) in Croatia! Apricot is my favorite

I served my brunch with a nice big plate of fresh fruit. Persimmon is in season, as well as apples and mandarines. Bananas are always around, and they are super tasty on pancakes, so I threw some in the mix as well.

My Guarantee: Winning the hearts (and bellies) of all your guests - whether vegan or not! The recipe is easy and doable, even if you are an amateur cook or new to vegan or gluten free preparations. Alternatively, do a few test runs before the actual holiday brunch - you know, just to make sure they turn out right!
