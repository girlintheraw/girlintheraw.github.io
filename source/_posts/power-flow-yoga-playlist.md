My yoga teaching style is constantly changing, adapting and evolving, just like most yoga teachers might say. I currently teach at a [few different locations](http://girlintheraw.com/group-and-private-yoga-class-schedule/), and a few different styles of yoga, each requiring different sequencing, overall mood and music in class! My most intense, sweaty and high energy class is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**hot power flow**</span> - and it requires a fun, upbeat playlist. If you're in the mood for a flowing energizing practice, than this power flow yoga playlist is for you!

When I first began practicing, and then subsequently teaching yoga, my choice of music was kirtan (style of music based on ancient, most commonly&nbsp;Sanskrit chants), meditative music, nature sounds.. you get the picture. The first time I heard Rihanna and such booty shaking music in class, I was surprised! I thought, well this isn't yoga now is it? I'm traditional like that, and as someone with a degree in Eastern Religions, and three years of experience living in an actual ashram or spiritual community, I had my doubts.

But it soon grew on me, and after years of teaching, I really appreciate the change in mood that music can make. Besides, slow meditative kirtan in a 105 degree heat with 40% humidity would just drive my students crazy! They love upbeat, rhythmic music to keep them going, and as the instructor, I try to keep their spirits high in whichever way possible. My hot power flow is definitely a form of yogic _tapas_ (austerity that generates heat and purification).

Here's a little preview of what a power flow practice looks like:&nbsp;

Now imagine that in a super hot room.. and a tad faster! Of course, practicing at the edge of the Grand Canyon was challenging enough in itself! Find more videos on my YouTube channel: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**[Matea Yoga](https://goo.gl/IQjGYS).**</span>

All of my classes, and hence playlists, start slow and gradually build up. They unwind in the same way, and my playlists always end with a calming song as we move towards _savasana,&nbsp;_corpse pose or final relaxation.&nbsp;I've created this playlist in [Tidal](http://tidal.com/), which is a service that provides high quality music. That is not to say it doesn't have it's drawbacks, as it's expensive, and I'm not in love with the actual App, there is much left to be resolved. You can create your playlists in many different&nbsp;[Apps and services](http://girlintheraw.com/yoga-playlist/) these days, so find the one that works for you.

This power flow yoga playlist is just under one hour, as I like to start with a few minutes of silence, breathing exercises, and intention setting, and end with meditative _savasana_.&nbsp;
