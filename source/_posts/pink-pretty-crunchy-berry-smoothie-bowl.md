**Smoothies are my obsession!** (Shocker)
I love juicing and fully believe freshly pressed juices are the healthiest thing out there, but smoothies are just so delicious… and so much quicker too! Whether I’m rushing out of the house in the morning, starving after a workout, or enjoying a lazy long breakfast, there is a good chance smoothie is in my hand! For those days when I have some time, I love to play around with my smoothies. I found that adding crunch and fruits to a frozen fruit blend makes it a full, very satisfying meal.

SMOOTHIE:
1/2 cup frozen peaches
1 whole banana (frozen or not)
1/4 cup frozen berry mix
1/2 cup unswetened almond milk
1 tbl maca powder
1-2 drops stevia (I used vanilla flavored)

TOPPINGS:
1/2 to 1 whole fresh banana
1/4 cup granola (I used Cascadian Farm Fruit &amp; Nut) - use raw granola, nuts or seeds for a fully raw meal

Smoothie bowls are the easiest way to play creative with your breakfast - your base can be built of any fruits, creamy, sweet or sour; and the toppings are endless. From fresh fruits, frozen berries, nuts and seeds, nut butters, superfood powders...
