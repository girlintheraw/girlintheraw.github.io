When I first embarked on a raw food journey, sweet balls became my staple. They were easy to make, satisfying, quick (no dehydration, long prep hours necessary), and most importantly, they hit that sweet tooth spot that is so hard to satisfy for me!

You only need a&nbsp;few ingredients to make up an easy base for sweet balls, like dates and nuts, and you can get as creative as you want from there. These&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Raw Vegan Coconut Cashew Sweet Balls**</span> are one of my all-time favorites to date!

I actually just stumbled upon these pictures today, and the truth is they were taken at least two years ago, probably closer to three. This is one of the very first raw food recipes that I've ever made, before I even had my Vitamix. Right before Christmas 2012, I decided I didn't feel as healthy as I would like to, and I embarked on a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Master Cleanse**</span>&nbsp;detox journey. I was on the cleanse for 12 days straight! It was quite a feat which I wish to repeat again (it just ain't easy to start!). I drank the Master cleanse lemonade, made with organic lemons, grade B quality Maple syrup, and cayenne pepper, mixed in the best water you can find, preferably spring. After completing the cleanse, I was craving foods - but only very light and nutritious. I eased out of the cleanse by eating a lot of raw foods, and this is how Girl in the Raw came to be!

Now, three and a half years later, I have gone through my ups and downs with raw food. One thing that made me eat more cooked foods is marathon and triathlon training, but it's not always the most optimal choice. I love to eat as much raw food as possible, preferably about 50%, on a daily basis. And one of the things that easily increase that raw vital food intake is Sweet Balls!&nbsp;

Benefits of Raw Coconut Cashew balls:

*   natural sugars from dates (which are filled with energy and are a great pre or post workout food)
*   coconuts are always a good choice! filled with healthy fats and amino acids
*   raw (preferably soaked) cashews are another healthy fat source that will keep you satisfied for a long time
*   rich in fiber making your belly happy!
*   nuts are a great source of raw plant-based protein
