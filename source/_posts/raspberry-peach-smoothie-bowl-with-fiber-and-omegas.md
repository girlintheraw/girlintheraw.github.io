I'm enjoying delicious seasonal fruits as much as possible. Before moving to Northern California, I lived in Florida, a place where seasons do not exist. We did enjoy an array of tropical fruits, such as mango, pineapple, avocado, even dragon fruit from time to time, but the change of seasons didn't bring about a great change at my local farmer's market. As I grew up in Croatia, my body is used to and enjoy change in seasonal produce more than I was actually aware of.

Now that I live in San Francisco Bay, I see the benefits. The seasonal, local fruits are so much juicier, sweeter, filled with _prana_ (life force), and when those greatly anticipated fruits and veggies finally arrive, I enjoy them that much more. I am taking full advantage of raspberries (my favorite fruit), strawberries, stone fruits like plums and peaches, and all the other wonders summer brings along with it.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Smoothie bowls**</span> are all the rage on Instagram, and for a reason. They are a delicious way to add fruits, superfoods and nutritional add-ons (think anything from protein powders to goji berries) to your every-day diet. Also, they are so yummy! Maybe I should have started with that. I love drinking a smoothie, and although it packs on good amount of calories (300+ very easily only on fruit, veggies and/or juice), it feels light - not like a full meal! So I tend to drink a smoothie, and then eat another, more substantial breakfast later.

Making smoothie bowls means combining the two, because you can make less of a smoothie than a full drinking (16 - 32 oz) cup, and top it with all the crunchy, granola, fibrous goodies you desire, making a full meal.

THE GOOD NEWS is even if the season of these fab fruits is over, most stores (specially health shops, from Whole Foods Market to Trader Joe's) store frozen peaches and berries year long! You can enjoy this smoothie bowl any season of the year.

###### INGREDIENTS:

*   1c frozen or fresh raspberries (can add a strawberry or two to it)
*   1/2 c frozen or fresh peaches
*   1 c vegan yogurt (I used plain coconut from So Delicious, use a raw one for a fully raw meal)
*   1/4 c ice (optional, if not using frozen fruits)

###### TO TOP:

*   3-4 tbsp Psyllium husk*
*   3-4 tbsp hemp seeds*
*   more berries
*   granola of choice

1.  This is as easy as 1-2-3\. Place all ingredients in a blender and blend till smooth. You might need to scrape the sides or add some water/almond milk, if the frozen fruits are turning your smoothie bowl into thick ice cream (and who doesn't like that).
2.  Top with your favorite add-ons, feel free to get creative.

###### PSYLLIUM HUSK

I can't remember if I even knew what this was when I first got it. Whole Foods sells it in bulk, and it's a great way to add a punch of fiber to your ever day diet. It's made of a husk of a seed, and it's simply known as a fiber-rich nutritional supplement, or in some places a laxative medicine. You can use Psyllium husk if you are performing colon cleanses or detoxes, there are quite a few laxative and cleansing products that contain it.

I personally eat it without seeing crazy fluctuations in my digestion (read: it doesn't send me to the bathroom like crazy), it just helps things go smooth. However, yours might be a different story, so start with a spoonful or two if you are not familiar with it or it's effects.

When you pour it over your smoothie, you will immediately see it absorb some water and form a nice, to me very tasty porridge-like cream. That's exactly what it does in your colon as well, it absorbs water and creates bulk to make bowl movements easier. Some information and research shows people suffering from irritable bowel syndrome and Crohn’s disease can benefit form it. Starting my day with it means having a smooth digestion tomorrow morning.

###### HEMP SEEDS

Hemp comes from the same plant that made you high in college, yes, but hemp seeds do not contain any THC and are not stimulants in any way. One of the most nutritious seeds in the world, hemp deserve to be called _superfoods_ because of it's protein content - excellent whole protein source for us vegetarians and vegans. They are filled with omega 3 and 6 essential fatty acids, Gamma Linolenic Acid (GLA), antioxidants, amino acids, fiber, iron, zinc, carotene, phospholipids, phytosterols, vitamin B1, vitamin B2, vitamin B6, vitamin D, vitamin E, chlorophyll, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, copper, potassium, phosphorus, and enzymes. They are a great raw food, and in my opinion, taste amazing for the benefits. They have a mild nutty flavor and a bit of a crunch to them. I never cook them, just sprinkle on my smoothies or salads.[![fsmooth4.jpg](http://girlintheraw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/fsmooth4-960x960.jpg)](http://girlintheraw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/fsmooth4.jpg)
