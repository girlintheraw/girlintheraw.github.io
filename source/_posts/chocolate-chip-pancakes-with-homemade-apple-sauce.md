Pancakes are the epitome of Sunday morning brunches. I love to save them for special occasions, after all, they are quite an energy treat.

I remember stopping at Cracker Barrel once (and only once) on a long trip, desperately trying to find something vegan to eat on their menu. Their menus include the calorie value of each dish, a practice I hope all (specially American) restaurants will adopt sooner or later for all of our benefit. Their breakfast of pancakes, maple syrup, sausages, eggs, and a bunch of other stuff that just doesn't go together at all, but is somehow the epitome of an all-American breakfast, tipped well over **1000, some even 2000 calories** per plate. (_Why doesn't it go together if you ask me? Because sweet and salty dishes just don't go together! Pancakes with maple and eggs? Yikes!_)

A daily calorie value of all your meals in one? That is not a good All in One deal. Let's not make that mistake at home.

No, pancakes are not a light dish. But as with everything, I give my best to healthy-fy them as much as possible, while still keeping them super delicious, sweet and yummy! Does that sounds good? Ok, let's go!

###### **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chocolate Chip Pancakes:</span>**

_{vegan, dairy free, egg free, soy free, processed sugar free, can be gluten free}_

*   1/2 cup gluten free flour (I used Trader Joe's mix)
*   1/2 whole wheat pastry flour (can replace for all gluten-free batter)
*   1/4 cup vegan yogurt of choice (I used plain coconut milk yogurt)
*   1/2 (approx.) cup of almond milk
*   1 tbsp chia seeds; soaked (as an egg-replacer)
*   Pinch Turmeric
*   Pinch salt
*   2-3 tbsp coconut oil, melted + 1 tbsp for frying
*   5+ tbsp chocolate chip squares
*   drop of stevia (optional)*
*   pinch baking powder (optional if using pastry flour)*
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">**FOR TOPPING:**</span>

*   3-4 medium apples, cut into cubes, and peel if not organic (can use more if you really like apple sauce, even save for later)
*   1/4 cup organic coconut sugar
*   pinch cinnamon
*   few tbsp of coconut yogurt

###### <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Instructions:**</span>

&nbsp;

1.  Mix all the dry pancake ingredients in one bowl.
2.  Prep your chia seeds and set aside (can use flax meal or egg replacer, or skip if using whole wheat flour).
3.  Blend all the wet ingredients in a blender, adding only HALF of the almond milk, and fold into your dry ingredients. If necessary, add more almond milk or water till the batter resembles a pancake mixture (not too dry or too runny). Depending on the type of gluten free flour you use, you might need more or less wet ingredients, as some GF flours drink much more than others.
4.  Fold the chocolate chip at the end and mix thoroughly.
5.  Heat a frying pan at high heat, add a tbsp of coconut oil, and when ready lower heat to medium and start frying pancakes (you can drop a bit of batter, if it's making frying sounds, then you are good to go). When top starts to dry, turn over. To avoid sticking, start with a hot pan and do not put sugar in your batter!
6.  At the same time, add apples to a small saucepan, cover with a lid, and cook at medium heat. If they are not releasing enough juice, or are getting stuck at the bottom, add a few tbsp of water. As they are softening, about 5+ minutes, add sugar, and continue cooking. You can keep them a bit crunchy, for very soft apples cook for at least 12 minutes. Add cinnamon at the end, and mix well.
7.  Stack your pancakes, top with fresh apple sauce, a few tbsp of coconut yogurt, a few sprinkles of chocolate chip, and enjoy to your heart's delight!

Satisfy the sweet monster (because let's face it, it's not my tooth that wants sweets, it's the monster that lives inside me!) with pancakes with a healthy twist. The chocolate chip, apple sauce and yogurt add just enough sweetness without putting you into a sugar coma, and the pancakes are light enough to be a breakfast/brunch, or dessert (in smaller amounts).

Maybe I'm just remembering the taste, and believe me, they were delicious! Try at home and tell me what you think!

**Bon Appetit! **
