##### Hello there!

###### Welcome to Girl in The Raw.

If you are anything like me, you might wonder who the person behind the blog you are reading is and why you should listen to anything they have to say. **Well because I'm awesome, that's why!**

All jokes aside, since I write about health, yoga, fitness and tons and tons of dietary tips, it only seems fair of me to share where I am in my life at this point in terms of health, and how I got here in the first place.

[![history2](http://girlintheraw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/history2.jpg)](http://girlintheraw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/history2.jpg)

Even though from a subjective perspective, becoming vegetarian, then vegan, starting to run and exercise, seemed like nature just taking it's course, the more I think about it, the more I realize there is a specific reason behind it. Even if we would like to take credit for just simply waking up '_smart_' one day and making '_smart_' decisions, there was probably a lot of trial and error behind the curtains that led up to any life changes we make. And that certainly stands true for me.

&nbsp;

##### **A sick kid...**

I was a very sickly child, I had most missed classes at the end of very school year compared to my classmates. I would get sick easily and I was highly allergic to a lot of foods, which taught me to control my eating habits early on. I can't remember when my allergies started exactly, it was innocent at the beginning - dog and cat hair, feathers and pollen.

**My allergies** soon grew to encompass a lot of foods - dairy, white flour (not exactly the same as gluten intolerance), sea foods, mushrooms, and corn. Random, I know. But the first two made sure I couldn't enjoy delicious European cheeses (Croatia, my home country, is famous for various special cheese types), yogurts and ice-creams - even chocolate was off the menu! Mind you, this was more than 20 years ago and there was no Whole Foods Market in my home town of Varazdin, Croatia. I had to settle for soy milk and tofu, and trust me when I say I was quite the weirdo among my friends for eating those foods. On top of it, I had to cut out white delicious breads, pastries, cakes, pretzels... the list goes on. I'll sum it up in one statement: **It sure wasn't easy**.

My allergies also induced a lot of breathing issues and skin rashes. My mom was getting a bit desperate, specially as the **allergens** would change randomly every few months. I would end up at the ER with a new issue every now and then, without my parents even knowing they fed me or exposed me to something they were not supposed to.

&nbsp;

##### **Discovering Ayurveda**

[caption id="attachment_1252" align="alignnone" width="1920"][![Source: axiomayurveda.com](http://girlintheraw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ayurveda-spices.jpg)](http://girlintheraw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ayurveda-spices.jpg) Source: axiomayurveda.com[/caption]

At about age 12, my mom, an eternal hippie, decided to take me to an Ayurvedic doctor. He was just visiting from another town, and she figured she'll give it a try. Bam, I was cured mere weeks later. Never had an allergic reaction since.

**My therapy** wasn't complex either, I can't even remember everything that happened. The doc first determined the cause of all my issues, which was a mix of a weak immune system, contaminated liver and psychosomatic factors. He said - we are allergic to someone, not something. The emotional allergies just transfer to bodily ones. That definitely held true for me. I had some therapy with the doc directly, and took some detoxing medicine, and that was it!

Although I was a kid, from that moment on I believed in this science without a doubt - I had more than enough proof! My mom was hooked too, and very soon began her collaboration with the aforementioned doctor. They opened a wellness center in my home town, and my mom became an Ayurvedic therapist soon thereafter.

I might have not been truly aware of it then, but I was very lucky to have access to this knowledge and practice as a kid. My immune system was still weak, and it took years for me to get rid of fatigue, kidney and liver issues, and much more. But I stopped taking allergy medicines that contaminated my organs, and began implementing holistic methods. My mom and my Ayurvedic doctor would give me regular treatments and my health progressively improved over the years.

&nbsp;

##### **Dietary habits**

As soon as the spell of food allergies was lifted, I started to eat uncontrollably again. I just love to eat, always have. My mom says I would make hilarious munching noises even as a baby (I still do, by the way. Total loud eater here). So, uncontrollable amounts of cheese and ice-cream it was! My doc would instruct me on eating according to my _dosha_ type, but it was so hard to control myself after all those years of having to skip birthday cakes and feeling like an outsider.

The body knows it's limits, though, even a young one. I was quite unaware of it then, because I didn't have much of a weight issue, but I am a total overeater. Borderline **binge eating**. From all the 'bad' eating habits we have, this is the one I would single out as my achilles heel. I would get a food overdose now and then, get sick from too much _kapha_ in my diet and had to slow down. My doc warned me about it, but I didn't listen much. Although the severe allergies were gone, I am to this day pretty lactose and processed flour and sugar intolerant.

&nbsp;

##### **Vegetarianism**

[![fruit-market](http://girlintheraw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/fruit-market.jpg)](http://girlintheraw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/fruit-market.jpg)

My mom has been a vegetarian for as long as I remember, I was maybe three when she stopped eating meat. She met a practitioner of _bhakti yoga_, started reading books such as Bhagavad-Gita, and made that lifestyle change. However, everyone else in my family, starting from my dad, thought that was super weird. My mom's pretty lenient and she never insisted on me not eating meat. I had her example my whole life, but always thought that vegetarianism was strange, because of all the external comments and influence.

Well, my Ayurvedic doctor was a vegetarian as well, eating raw foods for days at a time. I would start to hang out with a yoga crowd, and I soon began to understand just **why people choose vegetarianism**.

Sure the health benefits might be there, but to a teenager without much experience, it's not enough of a reason to change. However, I began understanding the ethical and moral reasons behind it, even spiritual if you will. My spiritual path was becoming more clear at the time, and I started to think more about the meaning of life. Eventually, I realized I do believe in a soul, and believe **animals are souls** as well, and I slowly transitioned to a vegetarian diet.

**I was about 16 when I turned vegetarian. **It took me a good year to become a full on vegetarian, slowly add more fruits and veggies to my diet, and remove meat. It takes time to learn how to read ingredients and cut out all non-vegetarian products like gelatin. Vegetarian meant I stopped eating meat, fish and eggs. I know some vegetarians think eggs are a vegetarian substance, but they never were to me. Not only are they a chicken's period (gross, I know, sorry), but they might be fertilized, specially if they are free range, which we have a lot of in Croatia.

Becoming a vegetarian was only a beginning of my health journey. I think I only started to recognize all the different tastes when I stopped eating meat. I am very lucky, as my mom is a great cook, and I learned how to cook myself early on.

&nbsp;

##### **Stop the Party!**

[caption id="attachment_1223" align="alignnone" width="800"][![In my teens...somewhere on the coast of Croatia](http://girlintheraw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/history5.png)](http://girlintheraw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/history5.png) In my teens...somewhere on the coast of Croatia[/caption]

Yep, that's me (and my matching BFF), shaking it out in the front row of a summer party a long long time ago.. Don't mind the guy behind me, this was in Croatia after all (yes, Croatian men look like that. No wonder I left). All I can say today is - hilarious. But it's all a part of my life and it happened for a reason.

I was a party kid in my teens. I had more than a couple of bad intoxicating habits. I definitely believe being a vegetarian helped me go clean, and I slowly toned my partying down as I was growing up. I still had emotional issues to deal with, and that is why I wanted to run away from reality and enjoyed partying. It wasn't until I stopped drinking and smoking and everything else, that I truly began feeling healthier. My immune system improved and I wasn't sick as often anymore. But it took my whole teens and then some to get there.

The party lifestyle took a toll on my health in an emotional sense as well. My relationships were not stellar - wether it was with party 'friends' or boyfriends. I felt like I needed a change, and the feeling kept on growing until I finally took the next step.

&nbsp;

##### **Lifestyle change**

**At age 20** I moved to Belgium for school. I was in a new environment, new fresh start. And as much as I loved it, the lifestyle shift reflected in my dietary habits. Talk about the freshmen 15\. I always thought that was a joke! But Belgium is so rainy, so cold, I was sitting all day... No smoking or drinking, the diet of the skinny girls from my past.

[caption id="attachment_1254" align="alignnone" width="483"][![Me circa 2008 (about 22 years old) in Slovenia](http://girlintheraw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/P1040293.jpg)](http://girlintheraw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/P1040293.jpg) Me circa 2008 (about 22 years old) in Slovenia[/caption]

I came home for the holidays mere three months after moving, and everyone was shocked at how much I had changed! I am petite (that's fancy for short), and even five pounds show! Everyone commenting on my weight and apparent change was a bad feeling! I felt quite awful if I may say, there is no other word to describe it.

&nbsp;

##### **Work it out **

Comments about your weight are great motivators, unfortunately. It was very soon after my holiday visit that I started to add exercise to my lifestyle. Therefore, it took a while. I've had some prior experience with it, but not enough to say I knew what I was doing. I got a Nintendo Wii the following Christmas, and began doing the Sport DVD workouts - yoga, tennis, running in place. I would also weight myself with it daily. It may sound hilarious, but it was a savior in the cold Belgian winter months.

I began running with my then boyfriend, now husband, and it was a long and painful road to making that habit stick. I would also do yoga here and there as I was a regular yogi practitioner in high school.

But to make those extra 10-15 freshmen pounds drop, I had to take a long look at my dietary habits. In my second year of college, I stopped eating regularly at school and started cooking myself. I had no kitchen at the dorm so I would head over to my boyfriends'. I would only shop every two weeks, but I instantly saw the increase in my fresh produce consumption.

The combination of healthier diet and exercise made me notice subtle changes on my body, and changes in my health as well - I went from catching every cold in a 10 mile radius, to going for months on end without a runny nose. When I would get sick, instead of holding on to a cough for weeks, I would get better in a few days.

&nbsp;

##### **Lifestyle change**

After graduating college I travelled a bit. My boyfriend and I stayed in Europe for a few months, then went to his native Colombia. There I discovered tropical fruits, and the beauty of going a whole year without seeing a snowflake. I joined a gym and worked out regularly - spinning, yoga, kickboxing. I ran more and more.

After South America, we moved to Miami, his hometown. Newly engaged to be married, in a completely new place (read city, country, continent), it took me some getting used to. Although I continued to work out, the combination of a good life in Colombia, and very strange GMO filled foods of the USA began to take a toll on me, and I was again back at my college weight. I was about 20 pounds heavier than my skinny 18 year old self.

[caption id="attachment_1255" align="alignnone" width="483"][![Me in 2004 (24 years old) in Colombia](http://girlintheraw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/history4.jpg)](http://girlintheraw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/history4.jpg) Me in 2004 (24 years old) in Colombia[/caption]

The change in **climate** and **overall lifestyle** impacts our health more than we know it. I simply grew up with different foods in Croatia, and literally everything I would eat in the US had a different effect on me. The packaged foods made me gain weight like crazy, and the produce was somehow never light enough, although the tropical fruits grow year long in Florida. It was time to take a long hard took at my habits, yet again!

&nbsp;

##### **Turning Vegan**

I had thought about going vegan for some time, and moving stateside eventually sealed the deal.

I read about animal abuse and connected with vegan communities online, so I eventually pulled the plug on my cheese obsession and dropped dairy as well. It wasn't that hard, considering I never found cheese or yogurt as tasty in the US as they are in Europe.

I stopped shopping the Publix generic brand, learning more and more about GMO, processed foods, and where this stuff we eat even comes from. It is so easy to get blindsided by **pretty packaging** and **promising advertisement**, specially for a newbie like me who had no experience in determining the quality of shops and products in a new place.

I began shopping at farmer's markets, U-picks and, of course, The Whole Foods Market. **For the first time in my own independent adult life, I began to invest in my diet**. I can say with confidence that I spend more money on food than anything else, besides rent. It wasn't easy either - I came from spending a few euros a week and eating pasta every other day during college, to making food my priority.

##### **Getting Hitched.. **

&nbsp;

##### In the couple of years after college, I went back and forth between Miami and Europe, until my husband and I finally settled down and got married.

[caption id="attachment_1257" align="alignnone" width="1036"][![Our wedding in Maui, 2012.](http://girlintheraw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/dsc_5223_0425.jpg)](http://girlintheraw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/dsc_5223_0425.jpg) Our wedding in Maui, 2012.[/caption]

Being married is a great opportunity to get comfortable, eat good foods and lounge around (and trust me when I say we do that. A lot!). But it is also a great opportunity to be each other's support in all the health endeavors.

My husband was a vegetarian when we met, we were both meat free for years and felt like we couldn't be with someone who's life habits were so different. We turned vegan together, and we also run and race together most of the time. It's great to have a partner in crime, though it can also be challenging because we push each other and blame each other if we fall of the course, whether it's diet or fitness wise.

&nbsp;

##### **Investing in my diet**

In order to find your optimal health, I believe it is best to first of all find the unhealthy attitudes have about our bodies, nutrition, and lifestyle. Once we have determined what those are, we simply need to _**reprogram**_ ourselves.

For instance, if you grew up in a place that is generally 'cheaper', and you move to a big city where your rent costs more than you ever thought you would be willing to pay (like myself), it may seem logical to skimp on food quality and try to save. If your parents never shopped in Whole Foods, and you ate like a college kid even ten years after graduation, eating 'healthy' or cooking at home may time some time getting used to. However, it is never to late and you can never give yourself too much healthy attention.

Our attitudes towards food, nutrition, lifestyle habits, finances, are all ingrained in us, whether we are willing to admit it or not. But just as we have learned our current habits, we can easily unlearn them and learn new ones.

My mom taught me to eat fruits and veggies, we had a huge field and I would pick my own produce as a kid. I drifted away from that lifestyle as was growing up, but it was pretty easy to tap back into it and re-learn healthy habits, and well as add on new ones.

&nbsp;

##### **Raw food world discovery **

[![greenjuice2.jpg](http://girlintheraw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/greenjuice2.jpg)](http://girlintheraw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/greenjuice2.jpg)

Come Christmas time in 2012 I felt very, so to say, stuffed. I was reading books on nutrition, health, detox, raw food, and running left and right. I am not even sure how, but I ran into the Master Cleanse book. I knew friends in Belgium who would detox now and then, but I felt like I never had the discipline for it. I am all in all a food addict.

But the timing was right, and my best friend on board as well. I completed full 12 days without food, and it was a discovery of a lifetime.

Just as the Master Cleanse Book suggests, getting off the lemonade juice fast should be a gradual process. In the first few days of the cleanse, I would crave bread and pasta, but as the days progressed, my body just wanted simple fresh foods. I was thinking about juicy mango, raw salads and nuts, and decided during the cleanse that I will eat raw at first to get used to foods again.

The cleanse was a perfect kick-start to my raw food journey, because after experiencing not eating solids for 12 days, I could feel just how harmful and heavy certain foods are. I ate high to 100% percent raw for the first few days after the cleanse, and slowly added some cooked foods till I was eating 60-80% raw. I began reading books, and before buying my dehydrator, I would actually sun-dry my crackers on the balcony - I lived in Florida at the time.

That was about 2 years ago, and I have gone back to eating more cooked than raw at the moment. I have learned a lot of recipes, nutrition, and got valuable feedback from my own body about the health benefits of raw food. Ayurveda doesn't advise it for certain body types, and I am still researching and making the connection between the two diets.

Right after my cleanse, the idea behind **GIRL IN THE RAW** was born. I began my social media accounts, starting with Instagram, and would share my new raw food discoveries. Although I am not fully raw at the moment, I still stand by my name and ideology - **I approach every aspect of health and a wholesome lifestyle from as raw of a perspective as possible**. It goes beyond just foods, I want to go back to basics and get the essence of yoga, Ayurveda, nutrition, healing techniques, running, spending time in nature...

&nbsp;

**Running Wild**

A few years after I started running in college, I was finally ready to run my first race! It took me a very long time to commit - I am a competitive person and I did not want to disappoint. I ran a 5k, Breast Cancer Awareness run, in October 2010 in Miami. It was a great first race, with thousands of people, cheering and music all around. I logged 29 minutes and change, meeting my goal of staying under 30\. After that, my love slowly started to grow.

[![run](http://girlintheraw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/run.jpg)](http://girlintheraw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/run.jpg)

I am lucky to have my husband as a running buddy, for a woman to train with a man is a great tool to push faster and harder. We ran a few 5ks after that, and joined a Triathlon meetup nearby. 2012 was a good year, I started to run more and faster, logging most of my 5ks in 24-26 minutes. I knew it was time to kick it up, so I signed us both for a half marathon in December. My husband was a life long athlete, and he had run a half before - however, that was 10 years ago. We trained together and enjoyed the race! I made it in 1:58, meeting my goal of staying under the 2-hour mark.

After that, I was surely hooked! More sprint triathlons ensued, with a few half marathons. I ran my first full marathon in October 2013 in Denver. Not the best idea, as I could have never trained for those conditions in Florida. I was in a great shape right before the race, but things started to wind down after the full. Training became slower and more gruesome, and I was a bit injured after the race. I ran my first half Ironman mere 2 months later, and a Ragnar a month after that.

&nbsp;

##### **Yoga lovin'**

[![hand-mexico](http://girlintheraw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/hand-mexico.jpg)](http://girlintheraw.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/hand-mexico.jpg)

Yoga definitely transformed my life for the better. Not only do I practice the physical asana, I dedicated my life to yoga when I graduated with a degree in Eastern Religions and Theology. I've travelled to India in 2007, my second year of college, and became familiar with the place where this beautiful practice originated, as well as the local culture, tradition and philosophy behind it.

I began practicing yoga at about 17 in my native Croatia. I was a regular for a few years, but going to college changed my asana practice, although I immersed myself into the philosophy of yoga more than I ever thought I would. I read, meditated and contemplated in that period. I knew, however, that I wanted to teach yoga from the get go, and would sometimes sub or assist my first yoga instructor.

I finally became a certified yoga instructor in 2013. When I'm not running, yoga is there to save me. I love it more now than ever, and absolutely adore teaching and brining Zen to others. I do feel the pressure of being in tip top shape when I step on the mat in front of a full room of people waiting for me to guide them in their practice. Although my niche is the philosophy of yoga, and meditation, the physical aspect is there nonetheless and I strive to become a better practitioner every day. I am not super bendy, I can't hold a scorpio in the middle of the room on my own (yet!), nor do I believe that is required to be a good instructor. I have definitely seen the progress and benefits of the practice and love sharing my experience with others.

&nbsp;

##### **And here is where I stand at the moment...**

&nbsp;

Last year, 2014 was not the best in terms of my fitness regimen, because I had to battle a few injuries after all that long distance racing. It is funny how the body knows to protect itself, and training for an endurance race such as a marathon may actually result in weight gain - at least it did with me. I also started eating more cooked foods again - I am just so hungry! (I laugh out loud writing this).

_**As with everything in life, "ideal health" is not a destination, it is an everyday process.**_

Some days I eat high raw, and some days I binge on vegan comfort food. Some days I run like a deer (or so I feel, obviously, I have no physical proof I actually look effortless when running, and I have tons of race pictures), and some days I sit on the couch very comfortably.

My health is in a great place overall, because I have no allergies, very few food intolerances, I have learned to control my eating habits and have reduced my binging significantly. I rarely eat out, I cook and prep most of my meals. **I am a confessed sweets addict**, and I am not even sure I want to get off it (sweets just taste sooo goood....).

I would like to be fitter and faster, and a better handstander while I'm at it, and I am always searching for new ways to add quality workouts to my lifestyle. I teach yoga for a living, and talk about health, nutrition and wellness like all. the. time.

Looking back on the long road that is my health history has shown me just how much I have learned and progressed. At the same time, I am always looking ahead.

**My goals** are to run regularly and practice yoga for the rest of my life. I strive to one day have a fresh garden (I'm a plant killer, tho, so this might take a while) and eat high raw foods and drink fresh squeezed juices every day. It's the simple things that make me healthy, happy and fulfilled.

Thank you for listening to my life story...

With love,

Matea.
