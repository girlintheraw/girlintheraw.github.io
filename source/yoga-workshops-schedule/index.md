## PREVIOUS EVENTS AND WORKSHOPS:

## Power Flow Workshop Series (4 classes)&nbsp;at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">[Hot Yoga Asheville](http://www.hotyogaasheville.com/)</span>:&nbsp;

###### Vinyasa Flow Yoga: Fundamentals and Technique

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">**February 13th, 2016 Saturday, 12-2pm.**</span>

Whether you are an experienced flow yogi or are tapping your toes into this style of yoga, you can benefit from this workshop. We will cover all the fundamentals of flow practice, starting with the Vinyasa sequence, paying special attention to proper technique in plank and chaturanga (low push-up). These are fundamental asanas (poses) that build strength to perform more advanced asana, specially arm balances and inversions. Besides making sure we are building upper body and core strength, we will also cover safety and avoiding common yoga injuries, wrists, elbows and shoulders.

Besides upper body work, this workshop will cover foundation of all common yoga asanas you are likely to encounter in any flow class, paying special attention to foot alignment, knee and hip safety in standing and balancing asanas. Finally, we will wrap up the workshop with neck, back and shoulder safety in poses such as bridge, wheel, headstand, shoulder stand, and plow.
This workshop will complement your personal and group yoga practice, and prepare you for the other three workshops in the series.
Physical practice and theory. No prior knowledge of poses mentioned, or flow practice, necessary. Open to all levels. Questions welcomed and encouraged!

###### Healthy flexible spine: Back bends and forward folds

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">**February 20th, 2016 Saturday, 12-2pm**</span>
Back bends are the foundation of a healthy and flexible spine, that is why there is a plethora of back bends yoga poses in any yoga style, specially flow or vinyasa. In this workshop, we will talk about proper technique and alignment in back bends, starting from basic, and slowly progressing to more advanced asanas.
The benefits of back bends cannot be stressed enough. In our everyday life, we tend to do exactly the opposite, round the spine, slouch our shoulders, and overall practice bad posture, standing or sitting down. With time, we loose shoulder and neck flexibility, develop aches and pains in our back, and lose the mobility of the joints and vertebrae. Back bends counteract all of that and more, creating a supple spine, opening the chest, and bringing back the vitality of the joints and the whole back. They are energizing, rejuvenating, and even restorative at times. Some of the poses we will cover in this workshop are bridge and variations, wheel and variations, bow pose, camel, dancer, and more advanced poses such as scorpio.
Back bending postures come hand in hand with forward folds, as they complement each other and allow the spine to move in all directions. In order to maintain a healthy spine, and to release all the work from the back bends, we will practice them in combination with restorative and healing forward folds. These are specially beneficial for anyone with tight hamstrings and lower back.

###### Standing Balances

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">**February 27th, 2016 Saturday, 12-2pm**</span>

Standing balancing poses, particularly asanas performed on one leg, award many benefits, including aligning the body’s center of gravity. These poses build strength in major lower body muscle groups, like quads and calves, as well as all the smaller muscles that support our joints, hence they are very beneficial to stabilize ankle, knee and hip joints. One legged balances build strength and stamina that is very welcomed in runners, cyclists, and other athletes.
Even relatively simple poses, like tree pose, are challenging when first practiced. This workshop will teach you key alignment and strength techniques to advance in balancing poses. After covering the basic, we will move on to more advanced asanas, challenging our balance and having fun in the process as these poses are very energizing and uplifting. We will practice Tree and variations, Standing bow or dancer, Half moon and variations (including bound and revolved), Warrior III, Standing Splits, Hand to big toe, Bird of Paradise and variations.
We will cover the basics of yoga energy locks, or bandhas, that are very helpful in finding our balance and equilibrium, and work with our yogic breath (pranayama) and focus (dristhi) as well.

###### Arm Balances and Inversions

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">**March 5th, 2016 Saturday, 12-2pm**</span>

The poses most of yogis stay clear from at first, but at the same time enjoy mastering the most in their practice, are arm balances and inversions. Inversions, or any poses where our heart is higher than our head, have been revered in the yoga tradition as the most energizing, uplifting and rejuvenating, bringing youth and overall vitality to the whole body. BKS Iyengar, one of the most prominent yoga teachers of our time, was said to practice inversions every day, well into his old age (he recently passed at the age of 97).
As beneficial as these poses are, they take some practice and investment from our part to master. We will start with the basic, and move on to more challenging balances and inversions. Knowledge and practice of chaturanga and plank poses come very much in hand here, and the whole vinyasa flow practice is designed around strengthening the body in preparation for these poses. We will cover arm balances such as crow and side crow, dragonfly, grasshopper, elephant, eight angle pose. In inversion, we will play with headstands and variations, handstands, forearm balance, scorpion, and shoulder stand.
Prior knowledge and strong practice of these asanas is not required! We will work with props, walls and partners, making this practice fun and safe for all.
