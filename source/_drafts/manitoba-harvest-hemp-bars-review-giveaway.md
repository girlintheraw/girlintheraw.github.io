New delicious products are on the market, and I am thrilled to be among the first to try them! I have been a big fan of hemp hearts, those crunchy little seeds filled with vegan protein and omega 3 and 6 amino acids. I am also a big fan of bars, as I eat them on the go between teaching classes. Now the two are combined in a product that I am surely to love! After all what's not to love? Few ingredients, all easy to pronounce and understand, high in plant based protein, and low in sugar, the Manitoba Harvest Hemp bars are a healthy treat.
