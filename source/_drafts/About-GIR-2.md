Hi! I'm Matea, aka Girl in the Raw. I love to eat and prepare delicious vegan [food](http://girlintheraw.com/category/recipes/), and talk about nutrition while I'm at it. I am a [yoga](http://girlintheraw.com/category/yoga/) instructor in the SF Bay area, and make yoga inspired jewelry in my spare time. I also love [running](http://girlintheraw.com/category/run-tri-race/), sometimes do triathlons, and hang out with my puppy a lot. I come from a history of being sick and unhealthy, that led me to find aÂ healthy lifestyle, and the transformational power of yoga. Find more about me and this blog [here](http://girlintheraw.com/about-girl-in-the-raw-2/).
