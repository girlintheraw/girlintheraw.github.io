###### **Yoga Technique Workshop**

Open to: All Levels. Great for beginners - learn the principles of Yoga poses and alignment; for advanced students - go deeper into your practice, build strength, flexibility and balance while avoiding injuries.

Yoga is an ancient science of performing asana (postures), breath (pranayama) and meditation (dhyana). According to this Eastern technique, performing these actions properly will result in physical and mental health, and overall well-being. In vinyasa or flow yoga, we often don’t have the opportunity to learn each and every pose in great detail. However, good form, alignment, and knowledge of yoga foundations is key to progressing, building a strong body and finding balance.
In this workshop, we will explore the foundations of poses, cover major alignment points, and learn the basics on which to build from simple to more advanced poses.You will learn how to properly build body strength, while avoiding risk of injuries, such as wrist, elbow and shoulder pain. This workshop will cover vinyasa or flow sequence, standing poses, standing and arm balances, and introduce basic inversion principles.

Some of the poses covered in this workshop:
• Vinyasa or flow - plank to chaturanga (low plank), upward facing dog and downward facing dog
• Upward dog and cobra, and the difference between the two
• Warrior I, II, III, Crow pose, Wheel pose
• Headstand preparation, shoulder stand, and neck safety

Join us for a hot flow practice that focuses on the Seven primary chakras or energy centers in the body. You will learn about each chakra, and it’s physical, mental and emotional effects, as you go through the asana practice specifically designed to bring them into harmony. Starting from the root or 1st chakra and building up to the crown or 7th chakra, we will dedicate a few asanas and breathing practices to each of them, and invite positive affirmations for each area of life they influence. The workshop will finish with a calming guided meditation and juicy _savasana_ as a way to balance the top three subtle chakras and bring all seven into alignment. Theory and asana practice.
